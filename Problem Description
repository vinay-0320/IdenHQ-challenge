Iden Challenge Instructions
Welcome to your data extraction challenge. This challenge will test your automation skills.

Your mission is to create a Playwright automation script using Python only that interacts with this application.

Mission Objectives
Create a Playwright script in Python that first checks for an existing session and attempts to use it.
If no session exists, authenticate with the application using the provided credentials and saves the session for future use
Navigates the hidden path to the product table: Navigate through a series of options to reach the product data table, which is hidden several layers deep in the interface.
Capture all product data from the table, including handling any pagination or dynamic loading.
Export the harvested data to a structured JSON file for analysis.
Submit your solution via GitHub repository on the "Submit Script" page.
Strategies for Excellence
Implement smart waiting strategies for elements to appear before interaction attempts.
Develop robust techniques to handle pagination or lazy-loaded content in data tables.
Properly manages user sessions.
Create clean, well-documented, and error-resistant Python code that gracefully handles exceptions.
Submission Process
